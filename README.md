# java_todo_api

Todo REST API built with Play framework and Java.

My first ever java project so here how it was.

## Dev log

### Day 1

* set up an IDE and figured out how to launch Play framework examples

### Day 2

* googled just every problem and almost gave up
* figured out how to make endpoints and in memory objects storage
* found out how to add third party libs

### Day 3

* made Postman collection to test API
* made JWT auth - that was a though one at first
* finished endpoints
* found myself writing big chunks of code without googling
* started writing tests 

### Plans

* finish tests
* add MongoDB storage
* dockerize app
* code some bonus functionality
